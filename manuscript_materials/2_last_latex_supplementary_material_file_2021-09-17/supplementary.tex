%%%%%%%% Source Data %%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Source Data 1.} File containing the list of all the references initially collected with information regarding the diffusion of particles in mucus. The references used in the meta-analysis are highlighted in bold.

\paragraph{Source Data 2.} Full dataset used in the meta-analysis. The first row is a header with designated column names fitted to the physical properties collected.  Particle name, particle type, zeta potential, particle size, effective diffusion constant at 1 s, anomalous exponent, diffusion in water, the ratio between effective diffusion constant at 1 s and diffusion in water, temperature, pH, dosing medium, the salt type used, salt concentration, mucus used in the experiment, mucus concentration, mucus purification, mucin gene expression level, and dominant mucin gene is denoted as Particle, Surface$\_$Chemistry,  Zeta,  Diameter, D$\_$w, Diffusion$\_$constant, alpha,  Ratio$\_$Diffusion, Temperature, pH, Dosing Medium, Salt$\_$type, Salt$\_$Concentration, Mucus$\_$Type, Muc$\_$Con, Purification, 'mucin gene name'$\_$EL, and Dominate$\_$Mucin, respectively.

\paragraph{Source Data 3.} This file contains the data analysis used to extract the dominant mucin for each mucus source. Mucin$\_$expression$\_$level. The first row is a header, and the first column designates mucus type. Represented expression levels are denoted as 'mucin gene name'$\_$EL. Expression levels are classified as below cutoff, 
low, medium, high, or unavailable. The average median Transcripts per million (TPM) for each mucin gene is designated as 'mucin gene name'$\_$TPM$\_$median$\_$avg.
